<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Graduated from Clarkston Highschool in 2017, I went straight from school to college. I began my education in Computer Science where I first began
    coding. Half way into the semester I didn't feel like I was being as creative as I thought I could be, I wanted to be able to look at
    something and say "I made that!". After looking into the Web Development and Design degree I felt I could let my creativity flow a little more freely. So I decided to switch my major to
    Web Development and Design. Now I really enjoy my professors, classes, and most importantly, my work. Now when I look at my assignments and other things
    I have done I have pride in being able to say "I made that!" and I am proud of myself. <h3>My Specialties:</h3>
    <strong>Items in bold I am currently learning:</strong>
    <ul id = "specialties">
        <li>Backend Development
            <ul id = "backendSpecialties">
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
    <li>WordPress</li>
    <li><strong>C#</strong></li>
    <li><strong>MySQL</strong></li>
    </ul>

        My parents, Brian and Laura Coughenour have been a driving part of my life in being and doing what I want in my education. They have taught me what to do, (and
        not do) as I slowly become my own person. My mom went through college when I was a child and I was about six years old when she graduated. My dad also went, to 
        college while I was a child, so they both had very strong work ethics, which I inherited. I'm thankful for the strong work ethic they have instilled in me because
        it has caused me to do better in class, and work. I currently am employed at Tomato Brothers in Clarkston, Washington as a support staff. I originally started working
        there as a dishwasher working in the back. Luckily my strong work ethic was able to get me out of the kitchen and into a much cleaner(and dryer!) work environment.
