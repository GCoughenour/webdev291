<h1>Animal Guessing Game Midterm Project</h1>
<p>HOW TO PLAY:<br>
    The sillouhette of an animal will appear on the screen, your job is to type in the text box
    what you think the animal showing may be. If you answer correctly you will get 3 things:
    <ol>
      <li>An image of the animal</li>
      <li>A fun fact on the animal</li>
      <li>A point added to your score</li>
    </ol>
      If you don't know what the animal is, don't worry, you have up to 3 guesses before the game is over
      and you have two hints you can use in one game. Your score will be kept track of as well as your number of
      hints, and guesses. There are 20 animals to guess, if you guess all 20 correct you win the game! Good luck,
      and have fun!

      <strong>NOTE:</strong>Some of the animals are mythical and/or do not exist in the real world, keep this in mind.<br>
